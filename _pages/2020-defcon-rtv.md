# DEFCON RTV 2020

## Description

DEFCON is the largest hacker conference/convention in the world, bringing thousands to learn the latest in various forms of hacking and technology. However, due to the COVID pandemic ravishing the globe, it was held online. This gave an opportunity for those who could never attend DEFCON, a way to participate. One of the villages, Red Team Village, hosted their Capture The Flag event online. Thanks to this, I was able to participate in something I've been wanting to do for years.
