# NSA Codebreaker Challenge 2019

## Description

The NSA Codebreaker Challenge provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse-engineering / low-level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission.

While the challenge is intended for students, professors are encouraged to participate as well. Furthermore, the site was designed to make it easy for those professors interested in incorporating the challenge into their courses to do so.
