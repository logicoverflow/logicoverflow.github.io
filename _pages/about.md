My handle is Logic Overflow, I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer, Security Researcher, and Educator.

My main focus lies in the field of Offensive Security/Read Team, but I have years of experience in IT, Project Management, and programming.

These github pages will contain posts on my experience, research, CTFs, walkthroughs, challenges, tutorials, and more, in which I have participated in over the years.

I hope you enjoy the content provided. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Best,

Logic
