I participated in DEFCON 2020 RedTeam Village’s Capture The Flag event this past weekend.

Continuing from the previous post, we’ll wrap up the __Crypto, Ciphers, and Encodings__ section for the tasks I’ve completed.

## Fifth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-AFSC-29331.png"></p>

Upon seeking this task, I immediately knew this was Morse code, which has dits (dots) and dahs (dashes).

Using *CyberChef*, let’s see what we’re being told.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-AFSC-29331-2.png"></p>

The Morse code writes out *Ditty Boppers*. For those who are unaware, *Ditty Boppers* were the Morse Code Interceptors in the United States Air Force Security Service. Reviewing the title, AFSC 29331, it stands for Air Force Specialty Code 29331, which were the point-to-point ground radio operators. We learn as with the other titles, this was our clue all along for those who may not have recognized that this was Morse code.

__Flag:__ ```dittyboppers```

## Sixth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-Two-Streams.png"></p>

We’re given a cipher which is already in the standard flag format with the only clue given is Two Streams. If you didn’t know much about ciphers in an attempt to learn what type it was, entering two stream cipher into Google would provide you a list of potential options it can be. Out of a semi-long list given, one of the options given is a *Bifid Cipher*, which breaks the message apart into two streams and then recombines them.

Using our ever useful companion CyberChef, let’s see if this option is correct.

Awesome, this option was correct and we got our flag. Something to note though, this could have been much tougher if they decided to add a keyword to this task. You would then need to know the keyword to decipher the string.

__Flag:__ ```ts{TwoStreamsAreBetterThanOneStream}```

## Seventh Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-number-letter-order.png"></p>

We’re given a cipher which consists of numbers and colons. Reviewing the title to help us get a hint, we learn that the order is important, while I’m sure the word fist was meant to say first. We can assume that the colons serve as a delimiter for each number for whatever it may represent.

Using *CyberChef*, let’s try to learn what potential cipher this may be. On the left hand side, we’re shown a number of different options for Encryption / Encoding.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-number-letter-order-2.png"></p>

After looking over a number of options, we find one which may work for our current situation.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-number-letter-order-3.png"></p>

Let’s enter the cipher and what the results are.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-number-letter-order-4.png"></p>

Success! We obtained our flag and the assumption of the colons being delimiters was correct.

__Flag:__ ```tslongestcomboeverrecorded```

## Eighth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-third-rail.png"></p>

This is a quite interesting looking cipher. We can see that it has all the elements of the standard flag format, but seems to be scrambled or shifted in a certain way. Looking for a clue from the title, we’re told not to touch the third rail, which I took as a train/subway reference.

Reviewing the options from CyberChef, we immediately notice that there is one called Rail Fence, which is just under the one we worked on. Let’s give that one a try to see what we’re given.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-third-rail-2.png"></p>

We enter it and run it and we’re still given something that is still scrambled, so we’re obviously missing something. Looking at the values which can be entered to help decode the cipher, we can recall the clue in the title, the third rail. Let’s try adjusting the key to 3 and check the results.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-third-rail-3.png"></p>

Seems like the adjustment did the trick and we got our flag!

__Flag:__ ```ts{ZigyzagyCipherFTW}```

## Ninth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-Mind-The-Padding.png"></p>

We’re presented with a task informing us that we’ll need a pad, which implies the technique used is a One-time pad. The key, which means the secret pre-shared key is the most famous animal of 2020. Obtaining the key requires a person to be familiar with the current events of 2020 as Google can not provide a direct answer. Furthermore, viewing other tasks in the CTF event has a whole section focused on Joe Exotic. This would imply the most famous animal in question is the tiger.

Solving this can be done by hand or using the tools we can find online, in this instance, we’ll use *rumkin.com’s One Time Pad*.

The message would be the cipher we’re trying to solve, *ma{qmeg}* and the pad would be the pre-shared secret key, in this case *tiger*.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-Mind-The-Padding-2.png"></p>

As we know the standard flag format, *ts{xxxx}*, we know the answer produced is correct. Furthermore, *tiger king* builds upon the events which has transpired this year.

__Flag:__ ```ts{king}```

That’s it for this section! We’ll cover OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) next so stayed tuned.
