The previous post wrapped up all the tasks I’ve completed for the Crypto, Ciphers, and Encodings section. As the title suggests, this post will cover Open Source Intelligence, better known as OSINT for short. For those who don’t know what OSINT is, it’s the the practice of using publicly (generally) available information, whether online or offline to gather as much data you can on your target. Why is OSINT important? It’s vital to do a number of jobs, whether it’s a missing person’s case, law enforcement, social engineering, or penetration testing, both network and physical; OSINT will help you get the information needed to move to you to the next steps so you can get the job done.

Open Source challenges can be quite vague, which requires you to think outside the box and figure out what they may be alluding to in their description.

The majority of these tasks have a fun twist as it’s based on the film Office Space. Let’s get started!

## First Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-543as.png"></p>

We learn that Peter Gibbons, an Office Space reference has been looking for a job. In today’s society, a majority of the job hunting, unless it’s through networking is performed online at various job sites. A big website which merges job searching and social media networking is LinkedIn, so we’ll focus on searching them first.

Let’s go to our trusty search engine and see what possible results we find.

As we can see, since Office Space is a popular movie and a cult classic, we’re going to receive a lot of hits. We need a way to narrow our search by adding more parameters. Reviewing the title, there is a flag number included, let’s use that to see if that may help us narrow down the list.

It seems entering the flag number in the title did the trick and we received a hit with one profile on LinkedIn.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-543as-4.png"></p>

Upon visiting the profile in question, we find the flag in the About section next to the flag number. We can now assume that all future searches involving LinkedIn and Office Space will have the flag number in them, which should help speed up our search.

However, there is something to note, if this is a new CTF event where the setup occurred a day or two before, there is a chance that the search engine crawlers have not scrapped a site to add to their index. In this case, we would have to rely on the site’s built-in search function.

Using LinkedIn’s search feature, we find it works just as well if we use the flag number from the title.

## Second Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-32798nm.png"></p>

It looks like Peter’s friend and colleague Michael is looking for a job at Penetrode. Since we’ve found Peter’s profile, we should be able to find Michael’s with ease.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-32798nm-2.png"></p>

Reviewing Peter’s Activities, we see that Michael has reached out to Peter, which gives us access to the correct Michael Bolton’s profile.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-32798nm-3.png"></p>

Once we’re on Michael’s profile, we’re looking for any signs of his job search attempts, particularly with Penetrode in mind. One of his activities listed lists just what we’re searching for. Let’s check it out to see if we can find our flag.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-32798nm-4.png"></p>

Michael has his resume posted and though it’s very small, we can see something that looks like the flag by his database technical skills. Let’s get a closer look to confirm.

Success! We’ve confirmed the small text is indeed the flag for this task.

## Third Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-443kj.png"></p>

The focus has shifted back to Peter, informing us about his specific set of skills. From our initial review of his profile, we didn’t see a skills section on his LinkedIn profile. Let’s take another look to see if there is anything that may reference his skill set.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-443kj-2.png"></p>

We find there is a post made by Peter asking if there is anyone hiring. Furthermore, the picture looks like as if it’s a resume. Let’s investigate his resume further to see if it holds our flag.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-443kj-3.png"></p>

We find on the second page of his resume, his work experience at Initech. In between all the explanation of his job responsibilities and skills, we found our flag.

## Fourth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-73843ri.png"></p>

We once again have shifted our focus over to Michael in our journey to find those flags. We’re told that his flag can be found in one of the big socials, implying one of the big social media platforms.

As we have with previous tasks, let’s try entering his name and the flag number into Google to see what we’re given.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-73843ri-2.png"></p>

It would see we got a good hit and even got the flag as well. Let’s take a closer look regardless to see if we find anything else.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-flag-73843ri-3.png"></p>

There are a few tweets which he has made, but that’s pretty much it. Viewing the live page confirms the flag that we saw from before is accurate.

This completes the first part of the OSINT tasks. Look out for my follow-up post which will wrap up the OSINT series.
