### Challenge

Chinchilla Challenge: Cuzcoâ€™s Great Adventure

<p align="center"><img src="/images/0x01.jpg"></p>

Cuzco, the chinchilla, had always wanted to go on a grand adventure. She was boxed in, surrounded on all four sides by walls, but she was getting faster. If she could 10x (a term for upskilling a lot) her skills, continue her practice jumps and codebreaking, then maybe she could break through her walls, and get to that Parkour class she wanted to take.

Just out of her reach was a folded paper, which she thought might contain more Parkour info. One day she spotted a ciphered clue fluttering near a lock and she thought it might help her break through her gate.

Crack the following message to help Cuzco with flag 2. For flag 1, what method is used to obfuscate the message?
