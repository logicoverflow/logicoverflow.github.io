The previous post completed the OSINT series, we’ll now be moving over to the Logs section. What is Logs you may ask? In this case it refers to Log Analysis.

Log Analysis is the evaluation or investigation of the records or logs that various IT systems generate, such as who logged into X server and when. Why is Log Analysis important? It allows for the investigation, review, or an audit of a particular system for various of reasons. These can range from confirming policy compliance or basic troubleshooting, to a security team responding to an offensive action that has taken place, and they need to piece together all the pieces of the puzzle to get an understanding of what happened and by whom.

As these logs can naturally be hundreds to thousands of lines, being very familiar with Linux and how to extract and manipulate data is vital. The methods used below are how I completed the tasks and by no way indicate that is the correct or only way. The methods everyone uses will vary upon their skill set with Linux and its related commands. Therefore, I may or may not be going the most optimal route in trying to obtain the flag, but it worked for me to accomplish my goals.

With all that said, let’s get started and check out those logs!

## First Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-What-failed.png"></p>

We’re informed that an organization has successfully thwarted hackers from getting into their server. We’re asked to see what service *fail2ban* was configured to protect. From a perspective point of view, perhaps we’re an intern at their company and they want us to gain some hands-on learning experience?

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-What-failed-2.png"></p>

We’re given a Google drive link containing a file called fail2ban.log, which can be assumed is an extracted segment of their main log created for us to review. Let’s download it to our Kali Linux VM.

We’re looking for what service this was configured to protect. From the initial display of the logs, we can assume it must be SSH, but let’s review the log a bit more first.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-What-failed-3.png"></p>

Obtaining the head and tail parts of the file confirm our initial thought that the service it’s protecting is SSH. We see we’re being informed if an IP address was already banned, the unbanning of an IP address, and some errors involving iptables and SSH. So it looks like we have our flag!

__Flag:__ ```SSH```

## Second Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed.png"></p>

It would seem that we’re working with the same log file for this task. We’re being asked how many different IP addresses were banned. Let’s investigate!

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed-2.png"></p>

We need to extract the IP addresses which have been banned during the course of this excerpt of the logs provided. There is a line where a Ban is occurring, so let’s use that to structure how we extract our data.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed-3.png"></p>

So I’m using __grep__ to find all the lines which contains the *“] Ban”* and saving it to a file called *banned*.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed-4.png"></p>

Awesome, our new file has only lines that show which IP addresses are banned. From a quick glance, we see that there is a lot of unnecessary information and some duplicate IP addresses. Let’s extract the IP addresses and remove those duplicates.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed-5.png"></p>

I’m using __awk__ to print out only the 7th column which is the IP addresses, we’re looking to get them sorted by using __sort__, and only display unique IP addresses to remove the duplicates by using __uniq__, all the while saving them to a file called *ipsbanned*.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed-6.png"></p>

We now have our list of IP addresses and since it’s a small file, we can easily count 8. However, what if it wasn’t that small and we can’t spend the time counting one by one?

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Who-failed-7.png"></p>

We can use the built-in function of __wc__ with the __-l__ switch to inform us how many lines there are in the file. We know this will produce an accurate number as the file only consists of unique banned IP addresses.

__Flag:__ ```8```

## Third Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-We-failed.png"></p>

Continuing with the fail2ban saga, we’re asked to see how many times the service reached an unrecoverable state.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-What-failed-3.png"></p>

Reviewing a brief highlight of the log file, we can see there is a line informing us of its inability to restore the environment. This must be unrecoverable state mentioned that they’re asking us to look into. Perhaps the team is interested in this piece of information to send it over to their developers to fix the bugs the service has.

Now that we know what text we need to extract, let’s move forward with doing so.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-We-failed-2.png"></p>

We use __grep__ again to extract all lines containing the string “Unable to restore environment” from the log file and saved it to a file called unrecoverable.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-We-failed-3.png"></p>

Confirming that we extracted the text we wanted, which we can see we did. Now we just need a count as to how many times this happened.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-We-failed-4.png"></p>

We learn this message or error as it is, occurred 48 times. With this piece of information, we now have our flag.

__Flag:__ ```48```

## Fourth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Whom-failed.png"></p>

We’re at the final stretch with completing all the Logs tasks. Our final task has us looking into what IP addressed was the most frequently banned.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-What-failed-3.png"></p>

Reviewing the file again, let’s go with the assumption the request is implying IP addresses that were already banned. With that in mind, let’s extract some data!

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Whom-failed-2.png"></p>

Using __grep__ once again, we’re going to extract all the lines which has the string “already banned” from the fail2ban.log file and save it to a file called alreadybanned.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Whom-failed-3.png"></p>

Taking a quick look at the file, we confirm we’ve extracted the data we wanted. Let’s now extract the IP addresses from the *alreadybanned* file.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Whom-failed-4.png"></p>

Using __awk__, we print out the 6th column, containing our IP addresses, we order them using __sort__, and then use uniq with the __-c__ switch to get a count of number of appearances for each IP address and save it to a fail called *albannedc*.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/Logs-Whom-failed-5.png"></p>

We view our file and see that there were 325 instances in which the IP address 92.252.94.69 was already banned. As this was the most frequent IP address listed from the logs provided, this must be our flag.

__Flag:__ ```92.252.94.69```

This wraps up the Logs section for the CTF event. Stay tuned as we’ll continue to cover more the challenges given to us by this year’s DEFCON’s RedTeam Village Capture The Flag event.
