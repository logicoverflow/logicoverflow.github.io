For the past couple of days, I’ve participated in the DEFCON 2020 – RedTeam Village’s CTF. The challenges covered a number of different topics, ranging from OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and Forensics to Cryptography and Tunneling/Pivoting. I wanted to cover the items which I successfully was able to complete through this guide. This will serve as a great learning reference for myself and others who may be looking as to how certain tasks were completed.

The first section I’ll be going over is __Crypto, Ciphers, and Encodings__.

First Task:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-All-about-that-base.png"></p>

We’re given a string of text with the hint that it’s based on a certain base of a number. Anytime an encoding ends with an equal sign, I automatically think of *base64* type encoding. Traditionally, we see *base64* encoded strings with two equal signs, not one. Nevertheless, confident that it has to be *base64* or in part of that family, so let’s head over to Kali to see if I’m correct.

Received confirmation it’s base64 and obtained our flag!

__Flag:__ ```ts{IsThisEncryption}```

Second Task:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-All-about-that-base-remix.png"></p>

We see something similar with the previous task, but this time there are three equal signs. Furthermore, the title of the task alludes that this is still focused on its base, but with a twist. Performing the same actions as before, let’s check to see if it’s still *base64*.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-All-about-that-base-remix-2.png"></p>

We learn that this isn’t a base64 encoded string, but I’m still certain it’s from the type of family… so let’s try to see if it’s *base32* encoded.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-All-about-that-base-remix-3.png"></p>

Success, confirmed that it is and obtained our flag!

__Flag:__ ```ts{ThisIstotallyEncryption!}```

Third Task:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-n-Eggs.png"></p>

This type of cipher is very obvious as to what it is since it’s pretty unique, it’s a *Bacon* or *Baconian* cipher. The idea behind this encoding is that the message is concealed in the presentation of the text rather than its content.

You’re able to google for any decoder, but a great one found on Github is the *CyberChef* (<a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/</a>), which allows for the encoding and decoding of plenty of different type of ciphers.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-n-Eggs.png-2"></p>

We’ve now obtained our flag and just need to put it into standard flag format for the event.

__Flag:__ ```TS{BACONISMYNAME}```

Fourth Task:

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-et-tu-brute.png"></p>

We’re given a cipher which resembles the standard flag format for the event. Reviewing the title of the task, it gives us the hint we need in order to decode this cipher. *Et tu Brute* is a reference to the Ides of March, when Julius Caesar was assassinated by the Senate. Hence the encoded string is a Caesar cipher, which is a shift-cipher, specifically, a rotation of 13 letters.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/CCE-et-tu-brute-2.png"></p>

Using *CyberChef* once more, let’s decode this cipher and obtain our flag.

Success! We have our flag.

__Flag:__ ```ts{AnOldieButAGoodie}```
