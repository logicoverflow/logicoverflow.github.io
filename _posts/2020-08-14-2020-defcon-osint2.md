I participated in DEFCON 2020 RedTeam Village’s Capture The Flag event this past weekend.

Continuing from the previous post, we’ll wrap up the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) section today.

## Fifth Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Michael-Bolton.png"></p>

For an interesting twist, our new task has us searching for a flag in a video on twitter! Notice that this time we’re informed of the author for this challenge. This can’t be an accident as the previous tasks did not have an author listed.

We learn that @pwneip is an organizer for the RedTeam Village at DEFCON. Let’s look through their twitter feed while keeping our eyes open for any Office Space references.

After searching through a number of tweets, a video from Samir, Michael’s friend and colleague was found. Furthermore, it seems he has a important announcement for us, let’s see what he wants to tell us: 

An embedded copy is below, but the official link is here: https://twitter.com/i/status/1291561754976309255

[![Watch the video](/images/OSINT-Michael-Bolton-3.png)](https://twitter.com/i/status/1291561754976309255)

After listening to his message, we can assume the last part of it is the flag we’ve been looking for.

__Flag:__ ```AllInYourCTFLikeAResurrection```

## Sixth Task

Oh the infamous type of manager we all hope we will never have in our lifetime, Bill Lumbergh. For this one, we are once more directed to @pwneip’s twitter account.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Michael-Bolton-2.png"></p>

We’re given a hint that the flag is near some type of ASCII art work. Let’s review his feed to see if we find some ASCII art.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Bill-Lumbergh-2.png"></p>

Our target has been acquired! We’ve found a Bill Lumbergh ASCII picture and it seems to have a flag in there as well. Let’s zoom in to obtain our flag.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Bill-Lumbergh-3.png"></p>

Success! Our flag is easily available to see now for us to submit.

__Flag:__ ```TS{HeyPeterWhatsHappening?}```

## Seventh Task

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets.png"></p>

It seems that we have wrapped up our Office Space references for the event. Have to admit that it was a great way to add some entertainment and fun to the event. Perhaps next year they can grab references from the movie Hackers?

Our new task has us attempting to find a flag with on twitter again. We’re given the hint that the flag is surrounded by their sponsors. We’re directed to view @NOPResearcher’s twitter feed.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-2.png"></p>

An amazing piece of knowledge to learn is that @NOPResearcher is the creator for the DEFCON 28 Red Team Village. Awesome stuff!

Let’s search through their twitter feed to find the RedTeam Village’s sponsors.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-3.png"></p>

As the event is going on, there are a lot of tweets and retweets on their feed… but we finally find a list of the RedTeam Village’s sponsors. Let’s take a closer look.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-4-800x462.png"></p>

It becomes quite apparent that one of these things is not like the others. At the bottom we find ourselves with an encoded string, which from our earlier experience informs us that this must be a base32 encoded string due to the three equal signs.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-5.png"></p>

We head over to Kali to decode our string and obtained our flag!

__Flag:__ ```ts{AllAboutThoseSponsorsandPrize}```

## Eighth Task

<p align="center">
Tweets 2

Follow for flags

I have a battlestation

author: @pwneip
</p>

I accidentally deleted the screenshot for this task, but the above is generally what the task consisted of.

Continuing the twitter feed hunt, we’re informed that there is a flag related to a “battlestation“. I kept thinking of Battlestar Galactica while doing this challenge, even having a few mistypes.

With BATTLESTATION in mind, let’s head over back to twitter to commence our search.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Michael-Bolton-2.png"></p>

We’re back on @pwneip’s feed, sifting through the tweets and retweets in our journey to find something related to “battlestation“.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-2-1.png"></p>

Great, we found their initial post where a #BATTLESTATION measuring contest is taking place and is looking for folks to reply with a picture of their battlestation for the CTF event. Let’s search the #battlestation feed.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-2-2.png"></p>

A lot of people participating in the event are replying with their battlestations. The search goes on to see if we find one that may potential have a flag.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-2-3.png"></p>

We may have found a picture where it looks like some text was added after the picture was taken… need a closer look to see what it may be.

<p align="center"><img src="/images/OSINT-Tweets-2-4.png"></p>

After zooming in to see the picture better, it looks like we got our flag!

That wraps up all the OSINT tasks for the event, keep an eye out as we cover other sections next!
